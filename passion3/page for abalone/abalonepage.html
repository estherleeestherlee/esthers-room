            <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Abalone shells are also known as sea ears or ormers. They resemble a large clam, except for the spiral whorl. All abalones have natural holes that run along one side. The mollusks that create these shells use the holes to breathe. Sea water is drawn in under the edge of the sea shell as it passes over the gills and leaves through the natural holes. They are usually found attached to rocks by a large muscular foot, mostly in shallow water. The foot is edible and highly esteemed. <em>Copyright© 2004 - 2022 Naples Sea Shell Company ®</em></p>
