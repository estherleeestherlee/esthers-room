                        Author is arguing that technology is not just wires & servers but also "the active human interface with the materials world." Perspective of "technology" seems to change depending on the development of the world & the atmosphere of the society.</span>

                        For some reason, this article reminds me of the history of cameras. In the past, it was possible to take a picture through various steps with hands, and now it is easy to take a picture through a smartphone. I think this aspect is very related to the situation of creating websites in the past and the present.
